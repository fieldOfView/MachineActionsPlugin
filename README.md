# MachineSettingsAction
Cura plugin which provides a way to modify printer settings (build volume, nozzle size, start/end gcode) from within Cura.

This plugin has been merged into the default Cura repository
----
This repository is kept for historic purposes, but will not be updated.



Installation
----
- Make sure your Cura version is 2.2 or newer
- Download or clone the repository into [Cura installation folder]/plugins/MachineSettingsAction

How to use
----
After adding a machine, go to "Manage Printers...", make sure your printer is active and select "Machine Settings"

Pro-tip: if you add a generic profile to the machine definitions and add ["MachineSettingsAction"] as a first_start_action, you get a nice solution to the "my printer is not listed" problem.
